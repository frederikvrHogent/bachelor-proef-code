This application integrates with 3 computer vision API's: Google Vision, AWS Rekognition and imagga. The app takes images in jpg format and presents them to the API's.
Each API returns 3 labels with confidence levels, these are normalized to a single data-format and saved in a csv.

Authentication for Google Vision, AWS Rekognition and imagga needs to be setup locally before usage.
